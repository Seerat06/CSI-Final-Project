# CSI-Final-Project
Venture Associates INC - KPI Performance Dashboard (CSI Internship Project)
🧾 Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard project was developed as part of my CSI Internship to analyze and visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) for Venture Associates INC, a manufacturing startup with 5 product lines: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Theta. The objective was to translate business requirements into an interactive and insightful BI dashboard, enabling data-driven decisions.

🏢 Company Background
Venture Associates INC, incorporated in 2018, manufactures five products and has recently adopted Power BI to enhance their business intelligence capabilities. Each product is managed by a Product Head and is evaluated based on five KPIs:

CPT (Cost Performance)

LVT (Logistics Value)

NKT (Net Knowledge Transfer)

MGT (Management Efficiency)

IDT (Innovation Development)

🎯 Project Goals
The primary requirements from the management were:

Slicers:

Product Head

Product Name

Selecting a Product Head dynamically filters the entire report for that product only.

KPI Table:

A matrix visual showing monthly trends of all KPIs over a 5-month period (Sep 21 - Jan 22).

Conditional formatting based on performance:

🔴 Poor (≤ LT)

🟠 Average (Between LT and HT)

🟢 Good (≥ HT)

Interactive Line Chart:

Shows the trend of a selected KPI over time.

Includes dynamic HT and LT dashed lines.

The line color dynamically changes based on KPI performance range.
